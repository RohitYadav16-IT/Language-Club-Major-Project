Code in Python that generates a random fill-in-the-blank quiz: 

import random

# Define a list of questions and their answers
questions = [
    "The capital of France is ___.",
    "The largest planet in our solar system is ___.",
    "The distance around a circle is called the ___.",
    "The fastest land animal is the ___.",
]

answers = [
    "Paris",
    "Jupiter",
    "circumference",
    "cheetah",
]

# Shuffle the questions and answers in the same order
qa_pairs = list(zip(questions, answers))
random.shuffle(qa_pairs)

# Loop through the shuffled list and create the fill-in-the-blank quiz
for question, answer in qa_pairs:
    # Replace a random word in the question with a blank
    words = question.split()
    blank_index = random.randint(0, len(words) - 1)
    words[blank_index] = "___"
    blank_question = " ".join(words)

    # Print the fill-in-the-blank question
    print(blank_question)

    # Prompt the user for their answer and check if it's correct
    user_answer = input("Your answer: ")
    if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print(f"Incorrect. The correct answer is {answer}.")


This code defines a list of questions and answers, shuffles them randomly, and then loops through each question to create a fill-in-the-blank version of the question by replacing a random word with a blank. It then prompts the user to enter their answer and checks if it's correct, providing feedback if necessary.
