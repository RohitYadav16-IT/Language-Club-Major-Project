code to display most searched words by other users :-

1.>Set up a database to store user search queries. We can use a relational database like MySQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.

2.>Create a table or collection to store the search queries. This table should include fields like the search query text, the date and time   of the search, and the user ID (if applicable).

3.>Whenever a user performs a search, save the search query to the database.

4.>To display the most searched words, we'll need to run a query on the search query table/collection. 

SELECT search_query_text, COUNT(*) AS search_count
FROM search_queries
GROUP BY search_query_text
ORDER BY search_count DESC
LIMIT 10;


This query will count the number of times each search query has been performed, group the results by search query text, and sort the results in descending order by the search count. The LIMIT keyword limits the results to the top 10 most searched words.

5.>Once we have the results of the query, we can display them on your website or application. we could show a list of the most searched words in a sidebar or at the top of your search results page.

6.>To update the list of most searched words in real-time, we could use AJAX to periodically refresh the list without reloading the entire page.
