Code to show trending words in each language :- 

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from nltk import FreqDist
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the list of languages and their corresponding URLs
languages = {'English': 'https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends/atom/feed?pn=p1',
             'Spanish': 'https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends/atom/feed?pn=p14',
             'French': 'https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends/atom/feed?pn=p15',
             'German': 'https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends/atom/feed?pn=p19',
             'Italian': 'https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends/atom/feed?pn=p23'}

# Loop through each language and scrape the trending words
for language, url in languages.items():
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'xml')
    items = soup.find_all('item')
    words = []
    for item in items:
        title = item.find('title').text
        words += title.split()
    # Get the frequency distribution of the words
    fdist = FreqDist(words)
    # Plot the top 10 words as a bar chart
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
    fdist.plot(10, title=f"Trending Words in {language}")
    plt.show()


In this code, we define a dictionary of languages and their corresponding URLs to the Google Trends feed. We then loop through each language and scrape the trending words using the BeautifulSoup library. We tokenize the words and compute their frequency distribution using the NLTK library. Finally, we plot the top 10 words as a bar chart using the Matplotlib library. The resulting chart shows the trending words in each language.
